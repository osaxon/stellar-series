### Project Summary

This ongoing side project touches on the capabilities of the new App router and Server Actions in Next.js. Exciting stuff!


#### Planning 

Building on insights gained from the preceding project, I've decided to take a much more thoughtful approach to the planning of this project. It's easy to just dive in and start writing code, but I've come to realise that this isn't always conducive to good development experience! In a similar vein to the old carpentry proverb - "measure twice cut once" - spending more effort upfront planning tends to result in fewer refactors.

#### Design 

### Development

#### Authentication  

One of my main goals for the project was to implement an authentication flow that allows me (or another an admin) to invite users by email to sign up to my app. This is a pretty common technique used with small SaaS products and start-ups, and if I'm ever going to think of that million dollar idea, I need to be ready to roll with these concepts!
<br/>
Here's a high level diagram of illustrating process for this feature.

#### Callbacks

The JWT callback is responsible for updating the token based on user information fetched during the authentication flow with NextAuth. I've configured NextAuth to use the Prisma database adapater, which means the JWT callback gets the information about the user from the User table in my database.

In the context of this setup, it plays a crucial role in customising the token with specific user details such as the user's ID, role, and name.

<Prism lang="js" code={`async jwt({ token, user, trigger }) {
            if (user) {
                token.id = user.id;
                token.role = user.role;
                token.name = user.name;
            }

            // triggered from client with useSession hook
            if (trigger === "update") {
                // the user obj is only available during sign in so we look up the user to get the updates from the db
                const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({
                    where: { id: token.id },
                });

                // update the token
                if (user) {
                    token.image = user?.image;
                    // other properties updates...
                }
            }

            return token;
        },`}/>


The Session callback is responsible for updating the user session based on the token information. It is executed after the JWT callback completes.
If both the token and the session's user information are available, it synchronizes key user details (id, role, name) between the token and the session.

<Prism lang="js" code={`async session({ session, token }) {
            if (token && session.user) {
                session.user.id = token.id;
                session.user.role = token.role;
                session.user.name = token.name;
                session.user.image = token.image ?? token.picture;
            }

            return session;
        },`}/>

#### Handling First-Time Login

The signIn callback checks if the user does not have a role assigned, implying it's their first time logging in. We can be sure of this as the database schema assigns a default role when a User is created, which only occurs after a succesful sign in.  

If there's no role for the user, it queries the database using Prisma to find an unused invitation linked to the email requesting to sign-in. If no valid invitation is found, the callback returns a falsey value and the user won't be able to sign in. This ensures only users who have been invited to the app by an admin are able to sign in.

<Prism lang="js" code={` async signIn({ user }) {
            let isAllowedToSignIn = true;

            // if the user doesn't have a role yet we can be sure this is the first time logging in
            // a default 'user' role us assigned to all new users in the database when created by the prisma adapter
            // in this case, we want to check if there's a valid invitation associated with the email signing in
            if (!user.role && user.email) {
                const invitation = await prisma.invitations.findFirst({
                    where: { email: user.email, used: false },
                });

                // throw error if no invitation
                if (!invitation) {
                    isAllowedToSignIn = false;
                }
            }

            return isAllowedToSignIn;
        },`} />
