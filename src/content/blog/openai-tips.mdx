# OpenAI Tips
Here are some tips and resources I discovered while working with OpenAI's chat and image generation models.

## Prompting
Prompting is the process of giving the model a starting point to generate from. This can be a sentence, a paragraph, or even a full page of text. The model will then generate output based on the prompt. Depending on the selected model, the output can be text, images, or both.

## Image Generation
Image generation is a new feature that was recently added to OpenAI's API. It allows you to generate images based on a prompt using the DALL-E model. The model will generate an image based on the prompt and send the image as a hosted url or base64 encoded string.

## Consistency
The DALL-E model is not consistent in its output. This means that if you give it the same prompt multiple times, it will generate different images each time.

## Fine Tuning
