# OpenAI Tips
Here are some tips and resources I discovered while working with OpenAI's chat and image generation models.

## Prompting
Prompting is the process of giving the model a starting point to generate from. This can be a sentence, a paragraph, or even a full page of text. The model will then generate output based on the prompt. Depending on the selected model, the output can be text, images, or both.

## Image Generation
Image generation is a new feature that was recently added to OpenAI's API. It allows you to generate images based on a prompt using the DALL-E model. The model will generate an image based on the prompt and send the image as a hosted url or base64 encoded string.

## Consistency
The DALL-E model is not consistent in its output. This means that if you give it the same prompt multiple times, it will generate different images each time.

## Fine Tuning
Fine tuning is the process of training a model on a specific dataset to improve its performance on a specific task. This can be done by providing the model with additional training data and retraining it on the new data. This can be useful for improviding the model's consistency and performance on prompts.
