# Portfolio and personal blog

## ðŸš€ Project Summary

This project is intended to highlight my skills and experience as a developer.

It uses the Astro framework with the buolt in content-collections API to serve markdown files for blog and project posts. Astro offers a unique way of developing websites and allows you to work with different UI frameworks and libraries such as React, Svelte or Vue to create reactive components for the site. 
For this project, I've used Preact for the reactive components, which is like a lightweight version of React which utilises signals for state reactivity.
